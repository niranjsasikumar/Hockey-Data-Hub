# Hockey Data Hub

Web application, currently under development, that displays scores, standings, schedule, stats, and team information for the National Hockey League (NHL). The app will include information for all past seasons since the first season (1917-1918) and live data for the current season. Uses data from the publicly-available NHL API.

Since the backend has not been set up yet, the hosted frontend uses sample data from the 2022-2023 season. The frontend is hosted [here](https://hockeydatahub.niranjsasikumar.com/). The "Teams" page is currently under development and as such will return a 404 error when attempted to access.
